What we built:
→ Created the .FAF format (IANA-registered)
→ First Persistent Project Context MCP (Anthropic-approved)
→ Context-Mirroring for all platforms

1/7 🧵
```

```
Why "FREE FOREVER" not "free trial"?

Because we're building infrastructure, not a SaaS business.

project.faf is to AI context what package.json is to dependencies.

You wouldn't pay monthly for package.json.
You shouldn't pay monthly for project.faf.

2/7
```

```
What's Context-Mirroring?

One project.faf → creates:
• .cursorrules (Cursor)
• .clinerules (Cline)
• .windsurfrules (Windsurf)
• CLAUDE.md (Claude Desktop)

Single source of truth, native files for every platform.

3/7
```

```
"README for the AI era" — Google Gemini

project.faf lives at your project root:
📁 package.json
📁 project.faf ← AI context
📁 README.md

Readable by any AI or human.
Version-controlled with your code.
Persistent across sessions.

4/7
```

```
We're not just another MCP server.

We CREATED the format:
✅ IANA-registered (application/vnd.faf+yaml)
✅ Anthropic-approved (First & Only for Persistent Project Context)
✅ Google Chrome-approved (Published extension)
✅ 12K+ downloads (Proven adoption)

5/7
```

```
Q: How do I get started?
A: Just USE FAF

```
Use FAF to initialize my project
Use FAF to sync to all platforms
Use FAF to score my AI-readiness
```

That's it. Start every prompt with "Use FAF"

## 🎯 FAQs for Launch

### Q: Is this really free forever?

**A:** Yes. MIT License. Open source. You can fork it, modify it, use it commercially, do whatever you want. No strings attached. We've already had 12K+ downloads. It's not going away.

### Q: What's the catch?

**A:** No catch. We're building infrastructure, not a SaaS business. FAF is like package.json - fundamental tooling that should be free and open.

### Q: Why should I trust you won't add a paywall later?

**A:**
1. MIT License is irrevocable
2. 12K+ existing users would riot
3. Open source - you can fork it if we go evil
4. Our business model is elsewhere (consulting, enterprise support, future products)

### Q: What does "Pioneer" mean? Do I get early access?

**A:** Everyone gets the same access (it's all open source). "Pioneer" just means you're among the first to use Context-Mirroring across all platforms. You help shape the format by using it and giving feedback.

### Q: Do I need to pay for support?

**A:** No. Discord community is free. GitHub issues are free. Documentation is free. If you need dedicated enterprise support, we might offer that later, but basic support is always free.

### Q: What if bi-sync doesn't work on my platform?

**A:** If our code fails, we will FIX it. It's as simple as that. Works on Claude Desktop (proven). Designed for all platforms (engineered correctly). If there are platform-specific quirks, report them and we'll fix fast. That's championship engineering - we don't ship and ghost, we ship and support.
