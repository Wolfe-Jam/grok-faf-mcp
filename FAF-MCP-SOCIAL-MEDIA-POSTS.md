### Technical Thread
```
🧵 We just launched faf-mcp v1.0.6 - here's what makes it different:

1/ UNIVERSAL - One MCP server, ALL platforms
   • Claude Desktop ✅
   • Cursor IDE ✅
   • Windsurf Editor ✅
   • Cline ✅
   • Any MCP client ✅

2/ CONTEXT-MIRRORING
   One project.faf → creates:
   • .cursorrules (Cursor)
   • .clinerules (Cline)
   • .windsurfrules (Windsurf)
   • CLAUDE.md (Claude Desktop)

Single source of truth. Native files for every platform.

3/ IANA-REGISTERED FORMAT
   Official MIME type: application/vnd.faf+yaml

   Not platform-specific. Not proprietary.
   A real standard that works everywhere.

4/ "USE FAF" PATTERN
   Just start prompts with "Use FAF to..."

   ❌ No web searches
   ❌ No manual file creation
   ❌ No guessing
   ✅ MCP tools handle everything

5/ CHAMPIONSHIP PERFORMANCE
   • 16.2x faster than CLI alternatives
   • 19ms average execution
   • 50/50 tools active
   • Zero memory leaks
   • Strict TypeScript

6/ FREE FOREVER - MIT License

   No trial. No limits. No catch.

   We're building infrastructure, not SaaS.

### r/ClaudeAI
**Title:** faf-mcp v1.0.6: Universal MCP Server (Works with Claude + ALL Platforms)

**Body:**
```
Just launched faf-mcp v1.0.6 - a universal MCP server that works with Claude Desktop AND all other MCP platforms (Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, etc.)

What it does:
• 50 MCP tools for AI context management
• Context-Mirroring: One project.faf → native files for all platforms
• IANA-registered format (application/vnd.faf+yaml)
• "Use FAF to initialize your project" - instant context

Key difference from other MCP servers:
✅ Platform-agnostic (not locked to Claude)
✅ Creates .cursorrules, .clinerules, .windsurfrules automatically
✅ Bi-directional sync (changes sync back)
✅ Championship performance (16.2x faster)

FREE FOREVER - MIT License

npm: https://npmjs.com/package/faf-mcp

Would love your feedback!
```

### r/cursor
**Title:** faf-mcp: Universal MCP Server with .cursorrules Auto-Generation

**Body:**
```
Built a universal MCP server that works great with Cursor!

Key feature for Cursor users:
• Creates .cursorrules automatically from project.faf
• Bi-directional sync (edit either file, changes sync)
• One source of truth, native Cursor experience

Also works with:
✅ Claude Desktop
✅ Windsurf
✅ Cline
✅ All MCP clients

50 tools bundled. FREE FOREVER - MIT License.

Installation:
npm install -g faf-mcp

Add to ~/.cursor/mcp.json:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "faf": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "faf-mcp"]
    }
  }
}

Then: "Use FAF to initialize your project"

### r/programming
**Title:** faf-mcp: Universal MCP Server with IANA-Registered Format for AI Context

**Body:**
```
Built a universal MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that solves the AI context fragmentation problem.

The challenge: Different AI tools want different context files:
• Claude Desktop → CLAUDE.md
• Cursor → .cursorrules
• Windsurf → .windsurfrules
• Cline → .clinerules

Maintaining 4+ files is a nightmare.

The solution: Context-Mirroring
• One project.faf (IANA-registered format)
• Automatically syncs to ALL platform-native files
• Bi-directional (changes in any file sync back)

Built with championship engineering:
• 16.2x faster than CLI alternatives (direct function calls)
• 19ms average execution
• Strict TypeScript, zero runtime errors
• 50 MCP tools bundled

FREE FOREVER - MIT License

npm: https://npmjs.com/package/faf-mcp
GitHub: https://github.com/Wolfe-Jam/faf-mcp

Open to feedback!
```

### r/opensource
**Title:** Released faf-mcp: Universal MCP Server (MIT License, FREE FOREVER)

**Body:**
```
Launching faf-mcp v1.0.6 - a universal MCP server that works across ALL platforms.

Why open source?
✅ Infrastructure should be free (like package.json, git, etc.)
✅ IANA-registered format needs open implementation
✅ Community can fork/extend/improve
✅ No vendor lock-in

What we built:
• 50 MCP tools for AI context
• Context-Mirroring (one file → all platforms)
• Championship performance (16.2x faster)
• Works with Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, etc.

MIT License. No subscription. No catch.

## 🟧 HACKER NEWS

### Show HN Post
**Title:** Show HN: faf-mcp – Universal MCP server for AI context (IANA-registered)

**Body:**
```
Hi HN! I built faf-mcp - a universal MCP server that works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, and all MCP-compatible platforms.

The problem: AI context fragmentation.
• Claude wants CLAUDE.md
• Cursor wants .cursorrules
• Windsurf wants .windsurfrules
• Cline wants .clinerules

Maintaining multiple files is tedious and error-prone.

The solution: Context-Mirroring
• One project.faf (IANA-registered format: application/vnd.faf+yaml)
• Automatically syncs to all platform-native files
• Bi-directional (edit any file, changes sync back)

Technical highlights:
• 50 MCP tools bundled
• 16.2x faster than CLI spawning (direct function calls)
• 19ms average execution
• Strict TypeScript, zero runtime errors
• Zero dependencies for MCP tools (bundled engine)

"Use FAF" pattern:
Just start prompts with "Use FAF to initialize your project" - the MCP tools handle the rest. No web searches, no manual file creation.

FREE FOREVER - MIT License. We're building infrastructure, not SaaS.

## 💼 LINKEDIN POST

```
🚀 Excited to announce: faf-mcp v1.0.6 is live!

We built a universal MCP server that solves the AI context fragmentation problem across development teams.

The challenge:
Different AI tools require different context files (.cursorrules, .windsurfrules, CLAUDE.md). Engineering teams waste time maintaining multiple files with duplicate information.

Our solution: Context-Mirroring
✅ One source of truth (project.faf)
✅ Automatic sync to all platform-native files
✅ Bi-directional updates
✅ IANA-registered standard (application/vnd.faf+yaml)

Built with championship engineering:
• 16.2x performance improvement
• 19ms average execution
• 50 MCP tools bundled
• 100% TypeScript strict mode
• Zero runtime errors

Works with:
✅ Claude Desktop
✅ Cursor IDE
✅ Windsurf Editor
✅ Cline
✅ All MCP-compatible platforms
