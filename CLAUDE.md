## 💡 Quick Start for AI

**Q: How do I use grok-faf-mcp?**

**A: Two options:**

**Option 1: URL-Based (Instant)**
```
Point your MCP client to: https://grok-faf-mcp.vercel.app/sse
```

**Option 2: Local Install**
```
npm install -g grok-faf-mcp

Add to MCP config:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grok-faf": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "grok-faf-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Then start every prompt with "Use FAF":**
```
Use FAF to initialize my project
Use FAF to score my AI-readiness
Use FAF to sync project context
```

## 🚨 NPM PUBLISH PROTOCOL - MANDATORY 🚨

**CRITICAL RULE: `npm publish` IS FORBIDDEN WITHOUT APPROVAL**

Before ANY npm publish of grok-faf-mcp:

1. **Follow the MCP Publish Checklist** at `/Users/wolfejam/FAF-GOLD/PLANET-FAF/PUBLISH-PROTOCOL.md`
2. **Run ALL checklist items** (build, tests, version, README, CHANGELOG, etc.)
3. **Request approval** with checklist results in the format specified
4. **Wait for OFFICIAL GO!** from wolfejam

**Required approval signals:**
- ✅ **"GO!"** - Approved to publish
- ✅ **"GREEN LIGHT"** - Approved to publish
- ❌ Anything else - DO NOT PUBLISH

**Why this matters:**
- First MCP server for Grok - sets the standard
- Elon/xAI reputation on the line
- URL-based deployment - production infrastructure
- One bad publish damages the entire FAF ecosystem

**No exceptions. No shortcuts. Professional. Boring. Trusted.**
