## "Sometimes, smart is free." - Deep Dive

### What It Says (Surface)
- Smart solutions exist that don't cost money
- Intelligence isn't always behind a paywall
- Quality can be FREE

### What It Implies (Subtext)
- You've been conditioned to think free = bad
- The industry charges because they can, not because they should
- We're confident enough to give away championship quality
- Infrastructure should be free (like package.json, git, etc.)

### Why It Resonates
**For vibe coders:**
- Not aggressive or elitist
- Welcoming (smart is accessible)
- Hopeful (you don't have to pay to be smart)

**For serious developers:**
- Challenges conventional wisdom
- Suggests sophisticated thinking
- Confidence in quality (no need to charge)

**For skeptics:**
- "Sometimes" = honest (not everything free is good)
- "Smart" = quality claim we can back up
- "Free" = no risk to try

## Comparison to Industry Taglines

### SaaS Products
- "AI that works for you" (generic)
- "Smarter context, better code" (claims without proof)
- "Context management made easy" (boring)

### FAF
**"Sometimes, smart is free."**
- Unique (no one else says this)
- Memorable (sticks in your head)
- Defensible (we prove it with FREE FOREVER + quality)

**Avoid in:**

**Use instead:**
- Technical: "Format-driven AI context (IANA-registered)"
